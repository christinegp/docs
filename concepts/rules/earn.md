# Earn Rules
Earn rules specify how members earn metrics (such as points) for each activity type. You can create groups of rules for each metric to specify what metric value is calculated when multiple rules are applicable.

## Rule Definition
Each row on the Rules | Earn Rules screen represents one rule. The *Calculation* column gives instructions to calculate the value of the metrics given. The *Condition* column gives the conditions under which the rule should apply and assign the associated metric. <!-- Expression vs. template && "if multiple conditions are specified they must all be true for the condition to be met"?-->

### Rule Examples

## Rule Engine Working Explained
*TBD* - explain how rule engine works at a high level

### Rule Groups
Create a rule group to specify what should occur when multiple rules are true.

### Rule Combinations
Create a rule combination to combine the sums of awards when multiple rules are true instead of the default action (choosing the highest award given from a rule and ignoring the rest).
