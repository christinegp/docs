# Tiering Rules
Create tiers to divide members into a hierarchy. Tier rules define the criteria for advancing from one tier to the next. Create tiers and tier rules on the Rules | Tier Rules screen. You can specify both basic and advanced tier rules. If more than one tier is applicable, the member is awarded the best tier they are eligible for.
