* Offer display


##Creating An Offer:


Action Types:

* Barcode - **TBD**

    Access promotions, discounts, deals, etc through the barcode. In a barcode offer, members will receive a barcode which can be scanned during check-out at a store to receive certain discounts and promotions. To access the offer, members open the application and click on the offer in the carousel to access the barcode.

* URL - 

    URL offers can be used to access promotions, discounts, and various types of offers online. You can type in the URL and get access to these types of offers that may provide discounts and various other opportunities to your members.

* *Offer Categories*: You can group offers into a broader umbrella, categories. This allows your members to more easily identify and group similar types of offers in the carousel.

* *Offer Tags*: Tags are another organizational tool that allow you to organize and keep track of your offers. Tag names are typically characteristic of the type of offer. Furthermore, tags are an internal facing tool. You and others with access to the marketing console can modify and create tags, but your members will not be able to see or access the tags. You can also use tags to faciliate searching, targeting, and filtering various offers. 

* *Offer Tracking Code*: The tracking code allows you to keep tabs on offer activity by using external analytic tools.

* *Status*: An offer can be in either draft, published or archived mode.
    - *Draft*: Members will not be able to view the offer in draft mode; only you will be eligible to view the offer in the marketing console and make modifications. An offer in draft mode will never appear in the mobile app.
    - *Published*: In published mode, members will be able to view the offer on the app. You will also still be able to make modifications to the offer but your members will be able to see these changes.
    - *Archived*: Members can no longer view offers that have been archived. They have been stored away.

* *Effectivity*: 
    - *Always*: You can make an offer always effective by selecting 'always' in effectivity. The offer will have no set timeline. 
    - *Schedule*: Select schedule when you want an offer to be active in a specific time period. This can apply to seasonal offers and discounts.

##Segments: 

Offers can be targeted toward specific member segments. You can make an offer redeemable to included segments and not redeemable to excluded segments, depending on your preference.

##Locations:

Offers can be targeted toward specific locations. You can make an offer available in included locations and not available in excluded locations.

##More Settings:

- *Limits:* You can set limits on an offer by giving members a maximum number of offers they can access in the offer carousel and setting an offer time interval for each member. In an offer time interval, offers will only be available for the specified time period to members. In addition, you can set the maximum number of offers that can be given overall.

- *Tracking:* You can track offer type, goal, and value through the tracking feature.

#Offer Sets

Offers sets target offers to the most optimal customer segments based on different contexts such as campaigns or display locations. You can group and rank these offers manually, by scoring rule, or automatically.

###Creating An Offer Set:

####Set:

- *Static:* This option is the number of offers explicitly included in the set.
- *Include All:* This option includes all the offers in the set (no specific number of offers is allocated).

####Ranking:

- *Manual Ranking:* Manual ranking requires you to manually rank each offer in the set.
- *Scoring Rule Ranking:* Score rule ranking will organize and rank offers based on the rules you wrote. Offers will be matched to these conditions. 
- *Automatic*: In automatic ranking, you do not have to specify the ranking of the offers. Instead, the marketer console will automatically make these choices. Automatic ranking hasn't been included in the marketer console.

####Tags: 

Tags are an internal facing organizational tool that allows you to organize and keep track of your offer sets. You can also use tags to facilitate searching, targeting, and filtering various offer sets.


- *Set*: Add any of the offers you created in the console in a set.

##Rules:

If offers match the conditions set by the rules, an offer will get a certain score. In cases where offers fall under multiple rules, the rule with the highest point value will be assigned to the offer.



##Offer Performance

Stellar allows you to gauge the performance of an offer by accessing an infographic that features visited location, viewed offer, and purchase. Through offer performance, you can visualize the impact of different offers on a selected metric by member segments. You can then determine the best types of offers to run for specific types of segments. 

##Settings

###Offer Categories:

Through settings, you can define categories to organize different types of offers. If you want display or listing to be organized, categories can allow organization of offers. Categories are member facing.
