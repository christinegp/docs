# Communications
The Communications module explores all tools dealing with the transmission of messages and the interaction with members.  Use *News Feed* and *Messages* to push out content and view what others are saying about your business.

## News Feed

### Understanding News Feed
News Feed serves as a channel where members can comment and interact with your brand. You can post updates and insights on offers and rewards here and members are able to comment, like and share the post. Hide/delete irrelevant posts from the public's view by utilising the *hide*/*delete* button. Use the top panel to post updates or upload pictures to be sent to the mobile app. You can also select the *segments* that you want to send your message for a more targetted approach. *Pin* important announcements or messages by utilising the pin tool located on each message.

### News Feed Settings
Use the Settings | News Feed Settings to edit settings for News Feed. You can specify and restrict commenting and posting permissions to certain members with this module. Post and Comment settings can be amended for approval before being published in real time using the *Post Visibility* and *Comment Visibility* tool. 

## Messages
Create targetted messages with the help of this module which can be done via push notifications or emails. The audience of the message can be grouped based on preassigned *segments* or even broken down to individual members. Use this tool to remind members of ongoing sales offers or to even push out new campaigns. Attach a tag to each message for easy categorisation or add in a tracking code to monitor its performance.
