# Locations
Keep track of different physical locations (stores, kiosks, etc.) with the Locations features. Create targetted content towards different locations (such as specific offers for different stores) and track user visits with beacons.

## Places
*Places* are any geographical location which are a point of interest. Create places to keep track of any physical location, including stores, kiosks, restaurants, stadiums, etc. Specify the physical address, operating hours, and phone number of the location. Create a *zone* to keep track of a more specific location within a *place* (See below).

### Zones
*Zones* are more precise locations within a *place*. *Zones* are most effective when they are within reach of multiple *beacons* (see below) that can identify positioning more precisely. Create *zones* on the viewing screen for a specific *place*.
<!-- Upload zone map? -->

## Beacons
*Beacons* are bluetooth devices that can be sensed by a mobile device.
<!-- UUID, major, minor? -->

## Regions
*Regions* facilitate targeting, segmentation, and analytics by allowing you to group *places* together.

## Explorer
<!-- Does not work -->

## Status and Effectivity
Change the **status** of a location to change the visibility of the location to members:

* *Draft*: Members cannot view the location. Edit the location on the console in *draft* mode.

* *Published*: Members can view the location and its details.

* *Archived*: Members can no longer view the location or its details. You can still view all archived locations on the console.

Change the **effectivity** of a location to designate the time frame for which members can view the location:

* *Always*: The location is always visible to members until manually archived.

* *Schedule*: Customize the time frame that the location is active.
