# Program Definition
Stellar Loyalty allows you to make direct changes to some of the attributes available to members. Use the Program tab to manage different program versions and change icons, descriptions, and functions. Some examples would include modifying member metrics, member preferences, activity types, etc.

## Program Metadata

### Member Metrics
Set up different metrics to determine how earnings and redemptions are being awarded to members. 

Metric Types:

* *Point*: Points are visible to members and serve as the most direct metric for earnings and redemptions. Edit the type of metric under the tab *Type* after creating a metric.

* *Activity*: The activity type is used to describe actionable items such as visits and engagement. 

* *Duration*: Duration is used to measure how much time a member spends on the app.

* *Distance*: Distance deals with location and is used to track how far away a member is from a particular vicinity of interest.

* *Spend*: Spend tracks how much the member spends on your business and on the app.

### Member Attributes
Member Attributes are useful for pulling information that you need from members. Member Attributes may include gender, email, address, etc. Key in a display name and fill in the relevant fields to create a Member Attribute. Selecting the 'Read-Only' option disables permission to edit the fields subsequently unless it is unchecked.

### Member Preferences
Member Preferences are used to track listed items indicated by users. This tab allows you to create and manage different preferences that these users can see from their application. Key in a display name and fill in the relevant fields to create a Member Preference. The 'Type' field containing the *Single Value* and *Multiple Value* allows you to give the user the option of selecting only one or have multiple choices respectively. Enter the allowed answer options for the user under the 'Domain' field.
