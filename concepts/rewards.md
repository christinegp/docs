# Rewards

Rewards are catalog items that a member can redeem for points. Use rewards to incentivize members to participate in activities.

Rewards are a type of program content and refer to [content guide](./content) to understand:

* Reward display
* Reward eligibility
* Reward lifecycle

## Reward Status, Effectivity, and Assignees
Change the **status** of a reward to change the visibility of the reward to members:

* *Draft:* Members cannot view the reward. Edit the reward on the console in *draft* mode.

* *Published:* Members can view the reward and are eligible to enter. You are restricted from editing some characteristics of the reward after members redeem it.<!-- Is this true? -->

* *Archived:* Members can no longer view the reward and are ineligible to redeem it. A reward becomes archived when the time frame given for the reward effectivity ends. You can still view all archived rewards on the console.

Change the **effectivity** of a reward to designate the time frame for which members can view and redeem the reward:

* *Always:* The reward is always visible to members until manually archived.

* *Schedule:* Customize the time frame that the reward is active. Includes the capability to have recurring rewards.

Choose an **assignee** for a reward in order to give ownership or responsibility for the reward to one or more team members. You can easily find the tasks assigned to a specific person by searching for a name in the Reward search bar.

## Sorting Rewards
### Reward Categories
Use the Rewards | Settings | Rewards Categories screen to define categories to organize different types of rewards. Add rewards to a category you have created by editing the Categories section of a specific reward.

### Reward Tags and Tracking Code
Give rewards tags and a unique tracking code to differentiate rewards for internal use.

## Reward Settings
### Reward Segments
Use the Rewards | Segments screen to specify one or more eligible segments for each reward. Use segmentation to target a specific demographic with the reward by including or excluding segments to be eligible for the reward. View the Members | Segments page to create member segments.

### Reward Locations
Use the Reward | Locations screen to specify one or more eligible locations for each reward. Target specific locations with individualized rewards by including or excluding locations. View the Locations page to create locations.

### Reward Limits
Use reward limits to control the number of times and how often members are allowed to redeem a reward. Edit reward limits on the Reward | More Settings screen. Specify the total maximum redemptions for all members, the maximum redemptions for each individual member, and the minimum amount of time between redemptions.

## Redemptions
Members redeem rewards with points (or any other awards metric of your choosing). Use the Programs | Member Metrics screen to define the types of awards.

Use the Rewards | Redemption screen to view the details of every individual redemption by members as well as a data spreadsheet for all redemptions. Press the *Export* button to download the data spreadsheet. Use the spreadsheet to change the status of redemptions from *pending* to *completed*, *errored*, or *cancelled* (in lowercase, it is case-sensitive). Save the edits to the spreadsheet and press the *Import* button to upload the updated spreadsheet. The status update will also be visible in the details of each individual redemption.
