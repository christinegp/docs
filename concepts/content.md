# Content
Entering the “master content” for offers, challenges, content blocks, etc. in the marketer console allows you to enter content for an entire template set and is thus inherited in all of the following  presentation modes. Some examples of content that you can add to the master content are headings, subheadings, calls to action, text bodies, details, and images. 

## Display Presentation
* Multiple presentation modes
You can then view the master content you inputted in the layout of various presentations of that content. The primary email block shows the layout of the master content if it were presented as the primary content of an email. The secondary emails 1 and 2 show layout of the content presented as secondary content in an email, following the primary content. The secondary emails 1 and 2 differ in their layout with images and text on opposite sides of the presentation. You can also view the layout of the master content presented as a tertiary email, medium and small email blocks, a medium rectangle, and on mobile (iOS, Android). In each of the presentations of the master content, when the master content is altered, the content in all of the presentations is also altered to match the master content. When the content is altered the layout of an individual presentation, the link from that presentation to the master content is broken.

* Multiple languages
To further customize content, you can specify a language/country for the content and alter the content to fit the audience of that language.

* Multiple layouts for a presentation mode
In individual presentations, the layout can be customized in various ways using the toolbar at the bottom of the specified content, such as by inputting text, links, and images, choosing a color palette for the presentation of the content, and moving around and changing the size of content.
