# Content
Entering the “master content” for offers, challenges, content blocks, etc. in the marketer console allows you to enter content for an entire template set and is thus inherited in all of the following  presentation modes. Some examples of content that you can add to the master content are headings, subheadings, calls to action, text bodies, details, and images. 

## Display Presentation
* Multiple presentation modes
You can then view the master content you inputted in the layout of various presentations of that content. The primary email block shows the layout of the master content if it were presented as the primary content of an email. The secondary emails 1 and 2 show layout of the content presented as secondary content in an email, following the primary content. The secondary emails 1 and 2 differ in their layout with images and text on opposite sides of the presentation. You can also view the layout of the master content presented as a tertiary email, medium and small email blocks, a medium rectangle, and on mobile (iOS, Android). In each of the presentations of the master content, when the master content is altered, the content in all of the presentations is also altered to match the master content. When the content is altered the layout of an individual presentation, the link from that presentation to the master content is broken.

* Multiple languages
To further customize content, you can specify a language/country for the content and alter the content to fit the audience of that language.

* Multiple layouts for a presentation mode
In individual presentations, the layout can be customized in various ways using the toolbar at the bottom of the specified content, such as by inputting text, links, and images, choosing a color palette for the presentation of the content, and moving around and changing the size of content.

## Content Eligibility
For all content, the marketer can decide which users that content is available to. Through the Segments tab in each individual offer or challenge, the marketer can add or exclude certain segments of users thus making them eligible or ineligible for certain content. 

## How to Use Content Editor
To use the content editor, the content is added in the master content area. In this area, the content requested is a Heading, Subheading, Body content, Subject, Preheader, Call to Action, and Details. Once inputted into the master content, the offer or challenge information is automatically reformatted to fit various displays. Below the master content, the displays shown are the Primary Email Block, Secondary Email 1 and 2, Tertiary Email Block, Medium Email Block, Small Email Block, Medium Rectangle, and iOS. The formatting and content of each display can be manually edited after the master content has been entered. For each display, the text can be edited, images can be added and altered, and the color palette of the template can be customized. The layout of each of the displays may also be manually adjusted as well by moving around and minimizing/maximizing content. 

## Content Targeting

## Content Lifecycle
The lifecycle of content is dependent upon whether the content is a draft, published, or archived. If the content is a draft, it will remain a draft until it is published by the marketer. Once published, the marketer can input the dates between which the content is available to users or make the content always effective thus becoming always available to users. If the content reaches the end date of effectivity, then the content becomes archived.
