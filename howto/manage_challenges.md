# Create and Manage Challenges

This *How To* will explore the steps to create and manage challenges in the Stellar platform. 

The steps involved in creating and managing challenges are:

1. [Create a New Challenge](#newchallenge)
2. [Manage Challenge Responses](#response)
3. [Publishing a Challenge](#publish)
4. [Finding a Challenge](#find)

## <a name="newchallenge"></a>How to Create a New Challenge
### Step 1 - Create New Challenge
* Click on the **Challenges** tab located at the top panel of the page. This will navigate you to the Challenges page
* Enter a display name for the desired challenge and click on the *Create* button

### Step 2 - Provide Basic Metadata
* Key in the relevant fields under the pop-up dialogue box of 'Edit Challenge'
* The Tags, Categories, and Tracking Code fields are useful for more advanced features
* Enter a desired amount metric to award members for completing a challenge under the *Award* field. *Auto Approve* will allow the Stellar Platform to assign points directly to the member for completing a challenge and would not need to be manually awarded by a marketer
* Click on *Save* to finalise the challenge creation and click on *Delete* to remove the challenge

### Step 3 - Design Display of Challenge
* Once the challenge has been created, click on the individual challenge post to navigate to the challenge's settings
* Edit the layout and visual representation of the various challenge displays under the **Display** tab
* Editing the Master Content allows you to view how it is displayed across multiple platforms (i.e. Email Blocks, Leaderboards, iOS, Android, etc.)

See [How to Use Content Editor] for details.

### Step 4 - Manage Eligibility
Manage who is eligible for an challenge by including and excluding segments and locations under the **Segments** and **Locations** tab respectively.

### Step 5 - Manage Limits and Advanced Settings (Optional)
* Go to the *More Settings* tab to access advanced settings for Challenges 
* Click on the edit button under the Limits tab to manage the limits for challenge availability for members
* Click on the edit button under the Placement portion to manage advanced settings for the challenge

* Click on the desired challenge response and click either approve or reject to execute that command on the response

* To publish an challenge, first click on the desired challenge posting to navigate to the challenge settings page
* Click on the edit button on the top right hand panel of the screen
* Change the status to *publish* and set the effectivity as desired
* Add *Assignees* to appoint a Marketer to be in charge of the offer
