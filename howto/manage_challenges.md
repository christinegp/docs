## <a name="newchallenge"></a>How to Create a New Challenge
### Step 1 - Create New Challenge
* Click on the **Challenges** tab located at the top panel of the page. This will navigate you to the Challenges page
* Enter a display name for the desired challenge and click on the *Create* button

### Step 2 - Provide Basic Metadata
* Key in the relevant fields under the pop-up dialogue box of 'Edit Challenge'
* *Display Name* will be the effective name of the reward. *Description* would ideally describe what the reward is used for and its properties. *Challenge Type* would determine the nature of the challenge offered to members. *Award* will determine the reward for the member when a challenge has been successfully completed. * The Tags, Categories, and Tracking Code fields are useful for more advanced features
* Enter a desired amount metric to award members for completing a challenge under the *Award* field. *Auto Approve* will allow the Stellar Platform to assign points directly to the member for completing a challenge and would not need to be manually awarded by a marketer
* Click on *Save* to finalise the challenge creation and click on *Delete* to remove the challenge

### Step 3 - Design Display of Challenge
* Once the challenge has been created, click on the individual challenge post to navigate to the challenge's settings
* Edit the layout and visual representation of the various challenge displays under the **Display** tab
* Editing the Master Content allows you to view how it is displayed across multiple platforms (i.e. Email Blocks, Leaderboards, iOS, Android, etc.)

See [Edit Content Display](./../using_content_editor) for details.

### Step 4 - Manage Eligibility
Manage who is eligible for a challenge by including and excluding segments and locations under the **Segments** and **Locations** tab respectively.

### Step 5 - Manage Limits and Advanced Settings (Optional)
* Go to the *More Settings* tab to access advanced settings for Challenges 
* Click on the edit button under the Limits tab to manage the limits for challenge availability for members
* Click on the edit button under the Placement portion to manage advanced settings for the challenge


## <a name="response"></a>How to Manage Challenge Responses 
* Use this page to manage member submissions in response to a challenge by either approving or rejecting submissions
* Click on the **Challenge Responses** tab located at the left panel of the page. This will navigate you to the Challenge Responses page
* Click on the desired challenge response and click either approve or reject to execute that command on the response


## <a name="publish"></a>Publishing a Challenge
* When a challenge is created, its status is set to *draft* mode by default
* To publish a challenge, first click on the desired challenge posting to navigate to the challenge settings page
* Click on the edit button on the top right hand panel of the screen
* Change the status to *publish* and set the effectivity as desired


## <a name="find"></a>Finding a Challenge
* Search for a challenge based on a tag or date created by keying in the relevant fields respectively
* Labels, Names, Assignees' Names, Assignees' Public Names, or Tag Names could be searched via the relevant field
* Further categorisation of the search results could be done by changing the *Status*, *Effectivity*, and *Date* fields 

**Hint: Tags will simplify searching and make things more easily sorted.*

## <a name="organise"></a>Organising a Challenge
* A challenge can be organised by first accessing the challenge's settings page
* Click on the challenge post and subsequently on the edit button to edit the challenge settings
* Organise the challenge by filling in the *Internal Name*, *Categories*, *Tags* and *Tracking Code* fields respectively. This will allow you to easily search and monitor a challenge in the future


## <a name="owner"></a>Managing Ownership
* Add *Assignees* to appoint a Marketer to be in charge of the challenge
* Click on a challenge post to access its challenge settings
* Click on the edit button on the right panel of the screen 
* Key in an Assignee Name under the *Assignees* field and save
* The Assignee can keep track of his/her tasks/ownership by searching for his/her Assignee name in the search field
