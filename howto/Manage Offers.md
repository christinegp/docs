## Use-cases for Offers

Offers are mainly used to run campaigns or promotions for your brand. You can choose to publish special offers for high performing groups or segments of your customers to reward them for their high engagement. You could also use offers to push up activity in low performing segments by limiting them to special segments or locations.
