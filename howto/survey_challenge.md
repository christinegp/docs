# Creating and Managing a Survey Challenge 

This *How To* will explore the steps to create and manage a Survey Challenge in the Stellar platform. 

The steps involved in creating and publishing Survey Challenges are essentially the same as creating a normal challenge with the only criteria being that **Survey** is selected as the challenge type. Refer to [Create and Manage Challenges](./../manage_challenges) for more details on how to create, manage, publish, organise, and find a challenge. Follow the steps below after creating a challenge for Survey Challenge optimization.

## <a name="new"></a>How to Create a Survey Question
### Step 1 - Create a Survey Question
* Create a Challenge post with the type being selected as *Survey*
* Click on the desired challenge post that was just created to be brought to the Challenge Settings page
* Click on *Response Settings* at the lower panel of the page
* Click on the *Edit* button on the right side of the bottom panel to navigate to the *Edit Response Settings* page

### Step 2 - Provide Basic Metadata for Survey Question 
* Key in the relevant fields under the pop-up dialogue box of 'Edit Response Settings'
* *Question Type* would determine the type of survey that you wish to create. *Numeric* refers to a survey question requiring a numerical response. *Text* refers to a survey question requiring a text response. *Rating* would refer to a survey question requring members to rate a particular item or service. *Multiple Choice* refers to a survey question requiring members to select a response from a list of options. *Image* refers to the picture of the survey challenge that will be displayed to members. The *Question* field would be the direct question being put forth to members. *Maximum number of characters* only appears if *Numeric* or *Text* survey challenges were selected. *Correct Response* allows you to determine the number of right responses to the survey question. *Share on News Feed* allows you to control if the completed challenge response is shared automatically or upon approval of the marketer.
* The preview panel on the left hand side of the window allows you to view your survey challenge before publishing it
* Click on the *Save* button to save the challenge


### Step 3 - Design Display of Challenge
* Once the Survey Challenge question has been created, click on the *Content* tab to manage the Survey Challenge's layout preview before it is attempted

### Step 4 - Manage Eligibility
Manage who is eligible for a challenge by including and excluding segments and locations under the **Segments** and **Locations** tab respectively.

### Step 5 - Manage Limits and Advanced Settings (Optional)
* Go to the *More Settings* tab to access advanced settings for Survey Challenges 
* Click on the edit button under the Limits tab to manage the limits for challenge availability for members
* Click on the edit button under the Placement portion to manage advanced settings for the challenge
