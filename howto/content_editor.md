# Edit Content Display

This *How To* will explore the steps in editing the Content Display in the Stellar Platform. The Content Display can be edited for a whole variety of actions and tools that can be performed with the Stellar Platform. These include Challenges, Offers, and Rewards.

The steps involved in editing the Content Display are:

1. [Editing Master Content](#master)
2. [Troubleshooting for Each Display](#trouble)


## <a name="master"></a>Editing Master Content
* Click on the post whose content is desired to be edited (i.e. Challenge Post, Offer Post, or Reward Post). This will navigate you to the settings page.
* Click on the **Content** tab located at the bottom panel of the page (for Challenge Posts and Offer Posts). Click on the **Display** tab similarly for Reward Posts. This will navigate you to the Content Editing tab.
* Locate the *Master Content* section located at the top of the tab
* Editing the Master Content will cause changes to be made to all other sections of the Content Editor
* There are 5 main icons that you will encounter in the Content Display Editor. They are namely: *Edit Text*, *Change Images*, *Position Image*, *Palette*, and *Preview*.

### Inserting Text
* Click on the *Edit Text* icon represented by the "A" letter
* Fill in the relevant fields of *Heading*, *Subheading*, *Body*, and *Details*

### Adding an Image
* Click on the *Change Images* icon represented by the bitmap
* You would be given the option of either uploading your own image or to insert a URL
* Click on the *OK* button and the image will be added

### Positioning an Image
* Click on the *Position Image* icon represented by the navigation symbol. This would only work if an image has been already uploaded.
* Click on the image in the content field and move it around with your mouse cursor to move the image in the same fashion
* To pan an image, zoom in and out while holding your mouse cursor on the picture. This changes the image that is being displayed on the content display.

### Choosing a Color Palette
* Color Palette represent a color scheme that your ceontent would embody
* Click on the *Palette* icon represented by a droplet to select a color scheme
* Use the navigation arrows to select a desired color scheme

### Preview
* Click on the *Preview* icon represented an eye to select the preview mode of your content


## <a name="trouble"></a>Troubleshooting for Each Display
There are several displays that are offered by the Stellar Platform. 

* For Challenge Posts, there are: Master Content, Medium Rectangle, Leaderboard, Wide Email Block, Medium Email Block, Mobile Carousel, Mobile List, and Mobile Detail. 
* For Offer Posts, there are: Master Content, Medium Rectangle, Leaderboard, Wide Email Block, Medium Email Block, Mobile Carousel, Mobile List, and Mobile Detail. 
* For Reward Posts, there are: Master Content, Wide Email Block, Medium Email Block, Mobile Carousel, Mobile List, and Mobile Detail.

### Editing A Specific Display
* The Stellar Platform allows you to edit a specific Content Display without changing the Master Content. This use-case is for optimising specific display templates or to send a slightly different message for different platforms.
* For instance if only the Leaderboard display is to be modified for a different icon, go to the *Leaderboard* display and make the appropriate amendments accordingly. This will not affect the Master Content or the other Content Displays
* If you wish to undo these changes, simply hold shift and click on the icon to revert back to the Master Content setting

*Note: Not all displays support image editing & panning even if it allows you to change images. The Content Display must contain the *Position Image* icon before it can be edited.*
