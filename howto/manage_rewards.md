## <a name="new"></a>How to Create a New Reward
### Step 1 - Create New Reward
* Click on the **Rewards** tab located at the top panel of the page. This will navigate you to the Rewards page
* Enter a display name for the desired reward and click on the *Create* button

### Step 2 - Provide Basic Metadata
* Key in the relevant fields under the pop-up dialogue box of 'Edit Reward'
* *Display Name* will be the effective name of the reward. *Description* would ideally describe what the reward is used for and its properties. *SKU* is used for stocktaking purposes. *Attribute Groups* will group rewards based on certain key attributes. *Metric* determines the type of reward used to award members. *Amount* would allow you to determine the size of a reward.
* The Tags, Categories, and Tracking Code fields are useful for more advanced features
* Enter a desired amount of points required for members to redeem a reward under the *Points* field. *Metric* allows you to select a given metric type for tracking the requirements needed for reward redemption (i.e. points, visits, spend, engagement)
* Click on *Save* to finalise the reward creation and click on *Delete* to remove the reward

### Step 3 - Design Display of Reward
* Once the reward has been created, click on the individual reward post to navigate to the reward's settings
* Edit the layout and visual representation of the various reward displays under the **Display** tab
* Editing the Master Content allows you to view how it is displayed across multiple platforms (i.e. Email Blocks, Leaderboards, iOS, Android, etc.)

See [Edit Content Display](./../content_editor) for details.

### Step 4 - Manage Eligibility
Manage who is eligible for a reward by including and excluding segments and locations under the **Segments** and **Locations** tab respectively.

### Step 5 - Manage Limits and Advanced Settings (Optional)
* Go to the *More Settings* tab to access advanced settings for Offers 
* Click on the edit button under the Limits tab to manage the limits for offer availability for members
* Click on the edit button under the Tracking portion to manage advanced settings for the reward
