### Step 2 - Provide Basic Metadata
* Key in the relevant fields under the pop-up dialogue box of 'Edit Offer'

* The Tags, Categories, and Tracking Code fields are useful for more advanced features
* Click on *Save* to finalise the offer creation and click on *Delete* to remove the offer 

### Step 3 - Design Display of Offer
* Once the offer has been created, click on the individual offer post to navigate to the offer's settings
* Edit the layout and visual representation of the various offer displays under the **Display** tab
* Editing the Master Content allows you to view how it is displayed across multiple platforms (i.e. Email Blocks, Leaderboards, iOS, Android, etc.)


See [Edit Content Display](./../using_content_editor) for details.

## <a name="use"></a>Use-Cases for Offers

Offers are mainly used to run campaigns or promotions for your brand. You can choose to publish special offers for high performing groups or segments of your customers to reward them for their high engagement. You could also use offers to push up activity in low performing segments by limiting them to special segments or locations.
