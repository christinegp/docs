* The Tags, Categories, and Tracking Code fields are useful for more advanced features
* Click on *Save* to finalise the message creation and click on *Delete* to remove the push message

### Step 3 - Manage Targeting of Push Message
* Once the message has been created, click on the individual push message post to navigate to its settings
* Manage the intended audience under the *Recepients* tab
* You can choose to send the message only to selected members, selected segments, or to all members
* Key in a member name or choose a segment and click on the call to action button on the right of the text field to confirm your selection

Manage who is eligible for a Push Message by including and excluding locations under the **Locations** tab

* Further categorisation of the search results could be done by changing the *Status*, and *Date* fields

## <a name="organise"></a>Organising a Push Message
* A push message can be organised by first accessing the message's settings page
* Click on the message post and subsequently on the edit button to edit the message settings
* Organise the message by filling in the *Internal Name*, *Message Type*, *Tag List*, *Image* and *Tracking Code* fields respectively. This will allow you to easily search and monitor a push message in the future
